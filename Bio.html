    <p style="color: grey;">Hi my name is Taija Floyd I am from Evergreen Alabama.I am an only child, however on my mother side I have three uncles and one aunt and five uncles and two aunts. Overall my family is really big on both sides. Growing up I became in love with drawing and painting. At an early age, I noticed down the line that I knew that I wanted a career in the field of art. So after that my mom to further pursue in high school, as more time I took the art classes in school I begin to enjoy and want to branch out into other things related to art.</p>
